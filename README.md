## Contributing Workflow

To help us collaborate smoothly, please follow this workflow when working on the project.

### Branching Strategy

- Do **not** work directly on the `main` branch.
- All new work should branch off of `dev`.

Steps to start working on a new task:

```bash
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```

### Pushing Code & Pull Requests

1. Push your branch to GitHub:

```bash
git push origin feature/your-branch-name
```

2. Create a **Pull Request** (PR) into the `dev` branch.
3. **Request a code review** from at least one teammate before merging.
4. After the PR is approved and merged:
   - Delete the branch on GitHub.
   - Update your local `dev` branch:

```bash
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
```

### Enforcing PR Reviews

Branch protection rules are enabled on `dev`. This means:

- **All changes must go through a pull request (PR)**
- **At least one team member must review and approve the PR**
- **Direct pushes to `dev` are blocked**

This helps prevent accidental changes. If youâ€™re unsure how to request a review, ask in the group chat.

### Summary

- Never commit directly to `main`.
- Always branch from `dev`.
- Submit PRs and request reviews before merging.
- Delete branch after merging.
- Keep your local `dev` updated after every merge.

When in doubt, ask questions in the group chat. We're all here to help each other.
